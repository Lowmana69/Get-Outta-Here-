You will be responsible for preparing a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers the following:
The overall concept of your application
Your motivation for developing the application
Your design process
Technologies used (and a brief description of how they work) A demonstration of the applicationâ€™s functionality
Directions for future development
Treat the presentation seriously!
Sometimes, talking intelligently about tech > doing tech.
